/* Testimonial images with object-fit: contain to preserve aspect ratio of image */

.media img{
   height: 150px;
   object-fit: contain;
   min-height: 100%;
   max-height: none;
   border-radius: 15% 15% 15% 15% / 10% 10% 10% 10% ;
}

I have added this CSS above to my home page to try to fix my image issues on small screens, but not sure if I have resolved this yet. 
This is a test to resolve my image issue on small screens.
